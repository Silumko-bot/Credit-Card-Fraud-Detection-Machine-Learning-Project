# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Machine-Learning-Project

# 1. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a real-world dataset. By leveraging advanced classification algorithms and thorough data analysis, this project aims to support financial institutions in minimizing financial losses and improving transaction security.

# 2. Project Motivation
Credit card fraud poses a significant threat to both consumers and financial organizations, resulting in billions of dollars in losses each year. As digital transactions become increasingly prevalent, the ability to quickly and reliably identify fraudulent activity is more critical than ever. This project was motivated by:

Industry Relevance: Fraud detection is a top priority for banks and payment processors, making it a highly sought-after skill in the data science job market.

Data-Driven Challenge: The availability of a large, balanced, and richly featured dataset provides an excellent opportunity to apply data science techniques to a real-world, high-impact problem.

Skill Demonstration: This project showcases expertise in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, machine learning, and evaluation—all essential competencies for a data analyst or scientist.

By tackling this challenge, the project not only demonstrates technical proficiency but also addresses a problem with direct business and societal impact.

# 4. Project Workflow
This project follows a structured data science workflow:

Import Packages: All necessary Python libraries, including pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and joblib, are imported for data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

Data Cleaning: The dataset is loaded and inspected for missing values, correct data types, and class balance. The data was found to be complete and balanced between fraud and non-fraud cases.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and summary statistics are used to understand the distribution of features, relationships, and patterns relevant to fraud detection.

Feature Engineering: All anonymized features are retained for modeling; no additional features are created due to the nature of the dataset.

Train-Test Split: The data is split into training and test sets to fairly evaluate model performance.

Baseline Model: Logistic Regression is used as a baseline classifier.

Advanced Model: Gradient Boosting Classifier is trained with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV for optimal performance.

Model Evaluation: Models are evaluated using classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC scores.

Feature Importance: Permutation importance is calculated and visualized to identify the most influential features.

ROC and Precision-Recall Curves: These curves are plotted to assess model discrimination and performance under different thresholds.

Threshold Tuning: The classification threshold is adjusted to balance business objectives.

Export Model: The best model is saved using joblib for future use.

Sample Predictions: The exported model is loaded and tested on new/sample data.

Conclusion: Key findings and recommendations are summarized.
